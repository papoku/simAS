All right, some bones and some meat on bones.
initDb.py is independent python script which initializes database with information from
fill.sql - which has two tables, Routers and Ports. !!! Please observe structure and suggest additions
main.db - sqlite3 database, made up from fill.sql

then, there is only one package, which has only _init_.. could be sufficient enough
database object has database as object (da-a) and cursor object, for communicating with database
command print for rows is bogus and obsololete, I am thinking of return format from database, and.. well.. it is yet to be considered.
